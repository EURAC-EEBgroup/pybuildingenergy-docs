# EN ISO 52016 — Multi-zone Calculation and Adjacent Zones

**EN ISO 52016 defines that:**  
The calculation now allows the definition of several **thermal** and **non-thermal** zones adjacent to the considered zone.


**External Adjacent – Unheated Zone**: It is possible to define an **unheated adjacent zone** in contact with the considered thermal zone.  
The length of the separating wall may be **entirely** or **partially** connected to the considered zone.  

The calculation involves:
1. Determining the **internal temperature** of the non-thermal zone.
2. Evaluating the **heat exchange** with the thermal zone.


**External Adjacent – Heated Zone**: In this case, the wall between the two zones is considered **adiabatic** (no heat exchange).
**Adjusted Coefficient**: To account for the **different temperatures** between zones (e.g., thermal and non-thermal), an **adjusted coefficient** is calculated.


### Assumptions and Simplifications
The standard defines various assumptions specified in section *6.5.3 — Assumptions and specific conditions*.  
In general, it aims to **simplify the zoning** approach by reducing the number of zones to a minimum (ISO EN 52016-2:2018).  

It also emphasizes that:

> *A multi-zone calculation with interactions between the zones requires significant and often arbitrary input data (on transmission properties and air flow direction and size).  
> It can also lead to other technical and procedural complications that add uncertainties to the results.  
> A further complication can be the involvement of different heating, cooling and ventilation systems for different zones, which adds to the complexity and arbitrariness of the input and modelling.*  

**Key Remark**: **Therefore, the benefits of calculations with thermally coupled zones can be smaller than the drawbacks.**
