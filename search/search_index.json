T_thr Constant \u03b7_nc (no more condensation) <p>This model offers a tunable middle ground between the simple heuristic and a full manufacturer curve \u2014 it\u2019s ideal for parametric studies or sensitivity analyses.</p> <p>3) 'manufacturer': it is a 1D (return) or 2D (flow/return) map based on the manufacturer curve.  <pre><code>if model == 'manufacturer':\n    # (a) 1D curve eff = f(Tret)\n    # (b) 2D surface eff = f(Tflw, Tret)\n</code></pre></p> <p>This model uses real efficiency maps provided by the equipment manufacturer.</p> <p>(a) 1D curve</p> <ul> <li>The efficiency is interpolated from a list of measured points: Tret = [20, 30, 40, 50, 60], eta = [109, 106, 101, 95, 93].</li> <li>Uses linear interpolation to find the efficiency for the given \u03b8ret.</li> </ul> <p>(b) 2D surface</p> <ul> <li>For more detailed manufacturer data, efficiency is given as a grid (matrix) depending on both flow and return temperatures.</li> <li>Bilinear interpolation is used between the four nearest points (Q11, Q12, Q21, Q22) to compute an accurate efficiency value.</li> </ul> <p>Meaning:</p> Type Inputs Accuracy Typical Use 1D Return temperature only Moderate Simplified manufacturer data 2D Flow + return temperatures High Detailed boiler performance maps <p>If the manufacturer data is missing or invalid, the function falls back to the simple heuristic.</p> <p>Calculation Model:</p> <pre><code>    'calc_when_QH_positive_only': False,\n    'off_compute_mode': 'full'\n</code></pre> <p>It controls what the program does when the heating demand (Q_H) is zero or negative \u2014 i.e., when there is no heating load required in that timestep.</p> <p>Every timestep in the timeseries (typically 1 hour) has:</p> <ul> <li>qh \u2192 heating demand in kWh</li> <li>\u03b8int \u2192 indoor air temperature</li> <li>\u03b8ext \u2192 outdoor temperature</li> </ul> <p>The model decides how to behave based on the value of qh and the user-defined policy flags:</p> <ul> <li>calc_when_QH_positive_only</li> <li>off_compute_mode</li> </ul> <p>These two flags control what happens when the heating load = 0.</p> <p>Step by Step Logic </p> <p>Example of input systems:  <pre><code>INPUT_SYSTEM_HVAC  = {\n\n    # ---- emitter ----\n    'emitter_type': 'Floor heating',\n    'nominal_power': 8,\n    'emission_efficiency': 90,\n    'flow_temp_control_type': 'Type 2 - Based on outdoor temperature',\n    'selected_emm_cont_circuit': 0,\n    'mixing_valve': True,\n    # 'TB14': custom_TB14, #  &lt;- Uncomment and upload your emittere table, oterwhise the default stored in gloabl_inputs.py is used\n\n    # --- generator ---\n    'full_load_power': 27,                  # kW\n    'max_monthly_load_factor': 100,         # %\n    'tH_gen_i_ON': 1,                       # h\n    'auxiliary_power_generator': 0,         # %\n    'fraction_of_auxiliary_power_generator': 40,   # %\n    'generator_circuit': 'independent',     # 'direct' | 'independent'\n\n    # Primary: independent climatic curve\n    'gen_flow_temp_control_type': 'Type A - Based on outdoor temperature',\n    'gen_outdoor_temp_data': pd.DataFrame({\n        \"\u03b8ext_min_gen\": [-7],\n        \"\u03b8ext_max_gen\": [15],\n        \"\u03b8flw_gen_max\": [60],\n        \"\u03b8flw_gen_min\": [35],\n    }, index=[\"Generator curve\"]),\n\n    'speed_control_generator_pump': 'variable',\n    'generator_nominal_deltaT': 20,         # \u00b0C\n\n    # Efficiency model\n    'efficiency_model': 'simple',\n\n    # Calculation options\n    'calc_when_QH_positive_only': False,\n    'off_compute_mode': 'full',\n\n    # Optional explicit generator setpoints (commented by default)\n    # '\u03b8HW_gen_flw_set': 50,\n    # '\u03b8HW_gen_ret_set': 40,\n}\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"it/iso_52016_input_check.md/","title":"ISO 52016 Input Check","text":"<p>The data provided before being used for the simulation are processed and evaluated to be considered fit for the simulation.
